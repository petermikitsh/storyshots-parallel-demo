# storyshots-parallel-demo

Companion repo: https://github.com/petermikitsh/storyshots-sequential-demo

Run storyshots in parallel (as opposed to sequentially).

Requires `yarn`, and `nvm` is recommended.

```sh
nvm use # or use Node v14.15.4
yarn install
yarn test
```

### Strategy B: Results (No Docker / cloud services only)

ðŸŽ‰ I COULD NOT HEAR MY COMPUTER FANS WITH THIS STRATEGY (the emphasis was necessary) ðŸŽ‰

Instead of spinning up Chrome and a static file server in locally running docker containers, use cloud services for both.

- Use browserless.io for Chrome/Puppeteer
- Use GitHub CDN for hosting built Storybook project

#### B: Generating baseline from scratch

Slightly more time than Strategy A.

Cost: This used 2,245 seconds (US $0.336) in Browserless computing power.

#### B: Verifying against an existing baseline

Time is slightly higher than strategy A, but I had left a `console.log` statement in test code, which might explain the 15% performance decrease.

Costs: This used 2,211 seconds (US $0.33) in Browserless computing power.

### Strategy C: Results

Strategy C returns to the "run everything locally in docker containers" model.

Lite Mode tosses out the raw CSF code, so you can't use it in test execution. This approach involves passing the needed metadata to the `testCsf` function, which is obtained by parsing done in `transformer.js` (the real heavy lifting is in `@storybook/csf-tools`).

An insignificant change in performance was observed.
